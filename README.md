# TEST NLP: spam classification

The purpose of this test is to evaluate your knowledge in Machine Learning, your programming skills and the way you approach a problem.

This test is a simple classification problem where you have to separate spam from non-spam.



## DATASET

The dataset comes from a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

It contains 5,574 SMS labeled with the ham (legitimate) category or with the spam category. 

## Deliverable

For this test, do not spend a lot of time on hyperparameters. The final metrics/results are far less important than all the process you went through to try to solve the problem.

The final repository should exhibit iterations of models/algorithm/sampling you used. If a method didn't work well, having an explanation/intuition of the problem is always a good point.
